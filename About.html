     <p class="newp"> I was excited to see that Company ABC is hiring an event manager skilled at increasing brand awareness and driving growth with high-traffic events, especially since I've attended several of your company's speaking events myself. With my five years of experience coordinating successful events in the corporate space, I'm confident I'm a great fit for the role. </p>

     <h2> Artistry </h2>
     <p> Starting at the age of 12 i picked up the habit of throwing on a nice beat infront of a group of people and rapping for 5-10 minutes straight and often times i would have people telling me to create a legit song or to get in the studio legitamately and thats what i did , i now have a beautiful catalog of 30 songs andeven a album to show for it thats listened to daily in most cities in america as well as internationally around the globe , keep in mind i got into this hobby before the big boom of artists in 2015 to 2021 </p>
