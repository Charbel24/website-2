     <h2> Artistry </h2>
     <p> Starting at the age of 12 i picked up the habit of throwing on a nice beat infront of a group of people and rapping for 5-10 minutes straight and often times i would have people telling me to create a legit song or to get in the studio legitamately and thats what i did , i now have a beautiful catalog of 30 songs andeven a album to show for it thats listened to daily in most cities in america as well as internationally around the globe , keep in mind i got into this hobby before the big boom of artists in 2015 to 2021 </p>
